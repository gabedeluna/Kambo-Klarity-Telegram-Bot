We practice TDD here. This is test driven development. Always make or update a test first with the requirements of the task, and then code to pass the tests, Modifying the code and tweaking it until all tests pass. Be mindful of testing edge cases and core functionality as well as proper error handling. 

Never create a file over 500 lines. Always check the line count of any new file you create or file you edit after you are done, if it is over 500 then find a way to intellegently break up that file into modules and always save the modules in a folder together. example command to check count:(Get-Content public/waiver-form.html).Count
