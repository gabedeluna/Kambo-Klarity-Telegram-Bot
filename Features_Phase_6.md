# Kambo Klarity - Phase 6 (A, B, C) Design Brief

This document outlines the design brief for the active and upcoming sub-phases of Phase 6 for the Kambo Klarity Telegram assistant:
*   **Phase 6A:** MVP - Client Booking Core via Calendar APP
*   **Phase 6B:** "Invite Friends" - Initial Setup & Invite Generation
*   **Phase 6C:** "Invite Friends" - Sharing & Friend Acceptance (Basic)

It details the aesthetic principles, practical considerations, project context, and functional design for each feature within these sub-phases.

## Design Brief

### Aesthetics

*   Bold simplicity with intuitive navigation creating frictionless experiences.
*   Breathable whitespace complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy.
*   Strategic negative space calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization.
*   Systematic color theory applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement.
*   Typography hierarchy utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture.
*   Visual density optimization balancing information availability with cognitive load management.
*   Motion choreography implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity.
*   Accessibility-driven contrast ratios paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability.
*   Feedback responsiveness via state transitions communicating system status with minimal latency.
*   Content-first layouts prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency.
*   **Inspiration:** The design of [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0) serves as a primary inspiration, particularly its dark theme, use of a dynamic video background (requested for the waiver form and implemented in the calendar, to be continued in [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0) and other new Mini-Apps like `invite-friends.html` and `join-session.html`), frog motif, and clean, modern layout achieved with Tailwind CSS. Subtle animations and clear visual feedback are key.

### Practicalities

*   **Project Goal (Overall):** Build a scalable, observable, feature-rich Telegram assistant for Kambo Klarity, emphasizing community building, intelligent scheduling, streamlined registration/waiver processes, and comprehensive admin management tools, as outlined in [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:8).
*   **Current Phase Focus (6A, 6B, 6C):**
    *   **Phase 6A (MVP):** Enable a single client to fully book a session: select type via bot -> open calendar app ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0)) -> pick date/time -> transition to waiver app ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0)) -> submit waiver. Session created in DB & GCal. Admin notified. Bot message updates to final confirmation (frog pic). (Reference: [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:239), [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:248)).
    *   **Phase 6B (Invite Friends - Setup):** Allow the primary booker, after their own booking is confirmed, to generate and see shareable invite links for friends via a dedicated WebApp page (`invite-friends.html`). This involves DB updates, API changes, and new UI for invite generation. (Reference: [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:241)).
    *   **Phase 6C (Invite Friends - Sharing & Acceptance):** Enable sharing of invite links and the friend's acceptance flow, including a landing page (`join-session.html`), API updates, and bot deep link handling for friend onboarding. (Reference: [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:243)).
*   **Target Users:**
    *   **Clients:** Individuals seeking Kambo sessions, interacting primarily through the Telegram bot and associated Mini-Apps (Calendar, Waiver, Invite Friends, Join Session).
    *   **Admins:** Practitioners or Kambo Klarity staff managing sessions, clients, availability, and other administrative tasks.
*   **Key Technologies & Stack:** (Consistent with overall project)
    *   Runtime: Node.js (ES2020, CommonJS)
    *   Bot Framework: Telegraf for Telegram
    *   Web Framework: Express 4
    *   Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM ([`src/core/prisma.js`](src/core/prisma.js:0))
    *   Frontend (Mini-Apps): Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS via CDN). New pages (`invite-friends.html`, `join-session.html`) will follow the style of [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0).
    *   Scheduling: Custom logic with `date-fns`, `date-fns-tz`, and live Google Calendar API ([`src/tools/googleCalendar.js`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0)).
*   **Design Philosophy (Derived):** Mobile-first, intuitive, frictionless, clear feedback, aesthetically pleasing (dark theme, video backgrounds, frog motif), performance-conscious.
*   **Development Constraints:** Files â‰¤ 500 lines, JSDoc, Conventional Commits.

### Context

*   **Project:** Kambo Klarity Telegram Assistant & Booking System.
*   **Foundation (Completed):** Phase 6 tasks PH6-01 through PH6-13 (detailed in [`TASK.md`](TASK.md:0)) are complete. This work established:
    *   Admin designation ([`bin/set_admin.js`](bin/set_admin.js:0)).
    *   Role-based command handling ([`src/handlers/commandHandler.js`](src/handlers/commandHandler.js:0), [`src/commands/registry.js`](src/commands/registry.js:0)).
    *   Database models for `SessionType` ([`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma:0)) and core DB access logic ([`src/core/sessionTypes.js`](src/core/sessionTypes.js:0)).
    *   Dynamic session type selection in the bot ([`src/tools/telegramNotifier.js`](src/tools/telegramNotifier.js:0), `/book` command in [`src/commands/client/book.js`](src/commands/client/book.js:0), callback handling in [`src/handlers/callbackQueryHandler.js`](src/handlers/callbackQueryHandler.js:0)).
    *   Live Google Calendar integration for availability ([`src/tools/googleCalendar.js`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0)).
    *   Supporting APIs: `GET /api/calendar/availability` and `GET /api/session-types/:id` ([`src/routes/api.js`](src/routes/api.js:0)).
    *   The initial dynamic calendar Mini-App ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0), [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:0), and its helper JS/CSS files).
*   **Current Design Focus:** This document provides the detailed functional design briefs for the features PH6-14 through PH6-34, covering the MVP booking completion (Phase 6A), and the "Invite Friends" functionality (Phases 6B and 6C), as specified in [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:263) (Section 11).

## Feature Functional Briefs (Phase 6A, 6B, 6C)

---
#### PH6-11.5: Enhance `SessionType` Model for Dynamic Flows

**Goal:** Augment the `SessionType` database model and related logic to support dynamic waiver requirements and group invite capabilities per session type.

**API Relationships:**
*   Impacts `GET /api/session-types/:id` (PH6-12) - it will now return these new fields.
*   Impacts `POST /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings` (DF-1) - this API will fetch these new fields to return to the client.
*   Impacts any Admin API used to manage Session Types (future feature).

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (DB Schema Update - `SessionType`):** Add the following fields to the `SessionType` model in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma:0):
    *   `waiverType`: String (e.g., "KAMBO_V1", "NONE", "ALT_MODALITY_V1"). Default: "KAMBO_V1".
    *   `allowsGroupInvites`: Boolean. Default: `false`.
    *   `maxGroupSize`: Integer. Default: `1`. (Represents total participants including primary booker).
*   **Req B (Migration):** Generate and apply Prisma migration.
*   **Req C (Seed Data):** Update seed data for `SessionType` to include appropriate values for these new fields.
*   **Req D (Core Logic Update):** Ensure [`src/core/sessionTypes.js`](src/core/sessionTypes.js:0) and any services fetching session types retrieve and handle these new fields.

---
### PH6-14: Calendar Mini-App: Fetch Initial Session Details & Display Availability
*(Goal and Acceptance Criteria as per [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:265). This feature is foundational for the MVP flow and its design aspects are critical, even if marked complete in [`TASK.md`](TASK.md:23).)*

#### Screen: Calendar WebApp ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0)) - Dynamic Interaction
##### State: Initial Load & Data Fetch
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client expects to see the calendar populate with their chosen session type information and current availability seamlessly after clicking "Book Now" in Telegram.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Loading Animation:** Upon entry, a visually subtle loading animation (e.g., a pulsing frog icon or a themed spinner as implemented in [`public/calendar-ui.js`](public/calendar-ui.js:262) `showLoadingAnimation`) is displayed to indicate data fetching. This should be non-jarring and align with the app's aesthetic.
    *   **Parameter Parsing:** [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:90) silently parses `telegramId` and `initialSessionTypeId` from the URL.
    *   **Session Details Fetch & Display:**
        *   [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:112) calls `fetchSessionTypeDetails` (from [`public/calendar-api.js`](public/calendar-api.js:33)) using `initialSessionTypeId`.
        *   The `sessionTypeNamePlaceholder` and `sessionTypeDurationPlaceholder` in [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:257) are updated with the fetched `label` and `durationMinutes`. This text should appear smoothly, perhaps with a gentle fade-in animation.
    *   **Availability Fetch:**
        *   [`public/calendar-data.js`](public/calendar-data.js:95) (`loadMonthOverview`) initiates fetching availability for the current month using the `sessionDurationMinutes` by calling `fetchMonthOverview` from [`public/calendar-api.js`](public/calendar-api.js:77).
        *   **Caching:** Client-side caching ([`public/calendar-api.js`](public/calendar-api.js:7), [`public/calendar-data.js`](public/calendar-data.js:6)) is used to speed up subsequent loads or month navigations.
    *   **Error Handling:** If API calls fail, [`public/calendar-ui.js`](public/calendar-ui.js:7) (`showError`) displays a user-friendly, non-intrusive error message (e.g., a temporary toast/banner that auto-dismisses or has a clear close option). The message should guide the user (e.g., "Could not load session details. Please try again or return to Telegram.").
*   **Animations:**
    *   Loading spinner/indicator.
    *   Smooth text population for session details.

##### State: Calendar Rendered with Availability
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client needs to easily identify which dates have available slots and select a preferred date.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Calendar Grid Rendering:** [`public/calendar-ui.js`](public/calendar-ui.js:54) (`renderCalendar`) dynamically generates day cells.
        *   **Visual Distinction:** Days with available slots are visually distinct (e.g., brighter text color `faf0e6`, bold font, potentially a subtle background highlight or dot indicator, as per `.calendar-day.available` in [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:81)). Non-available days are muted (e.g., `rgba(245, 245, 220, 0.3)` color).
        *   **Today's Date:** Consider a subtle visual cue for the current day if it's in the displayed month.
    *   **Visual Hierarchy:** Available dates should clearly pop out against unavailable ones. The current month/year display (`currentMonthYear`) is prominent.
    *   **Feedback on Hover/Tap (Available Day):**
        *   Hover (desktop): Day cell subtly changes background (e.g., `rgba(83, 210, 44, 0.2)`), text color becomes accent green (`#53d22c`), and scales slightly (transform: `scale(1.1)`) as per [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:86).
        *   Tap (mobile): Provides immediate visual feedback of interaction before selection confirmation.
*   **Animations:**
    *   Smooth transition effects on hover/tap for available days.
    *   Calendar grid itself could fade in once data is ready, replacing the loading animation.

##### State: Date Selected
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client wants to see available time slots for their chosen date and confirm their date selection.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Selection Feedback:** Clicking an available day calls `selectDate` in [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:22). The selected day receives a strong visual highlight (e.g., solid accent green background `#53d22c`, contrasting text color `#162013`, slight scale, shadow, as per `.calendar-day.selected` in [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:92)). Any previously selected day returns to its normal available state.
    *   **UI Update (Progressive Disclosure):**
        *   The "Select an available day" message (`selectDateMessage`) is hidden.
        *   The time picker container (`timePickerContainer`) becomes visible (e.g., slides or fades in).
        *   The booking summary text (`selectedBookingInfo`) updates to show the fully selected date (e.g., "Monday, June 10 - Select a time") or immediately with the first available/auto-selected time.
    *   **Time Slot Loading & Rendering:**
        *   [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:84) (`loadAndRenderTimeSlotsForDate`) uses `getSlotsForDate` (from [`public/calendar-api.js`](public/calendar-api.js:131)) to retrieve slots from `monthSlotData`.
        *   [`public/calendar-ui.js`](public/calendar-ui.js:117) (`renderTimeSlotsForDate`) populates the `timeSlotList`. Slots are formatted to the user's local time, including timezone abbreviation.
        *   If no slots are available for a selected *available* day (edge case, could happen if availability changes rapidly), the UI should clearly state "No time slots available for this date" in both the time scroller and booking summary. The submit button remains disabled.
*   **Animations:**
    *   Transition for selected day style.
    *   Time picker container animates into view.
    *   Time slots list populates smoothly.

##### State: Scrolling/Selecting Time Slot
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client needs to easily browse and select a specific time for their session.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Scroll Interaction:** The `timeSlotList` is a vertically scrollable list. The central item in the viewport is considered "selected" or "focused". The `selectorBar` in [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:309) provides a persistent visual indication of the selection area.
    *   **Dynamic Feedback (Scroll-to-Select):** As the user scrolls, [`public/calendar-ui.js`](public/calendar-ui.js:169) (`setupTimeSlotScrollDisplay` and `updateTimeDisplay`) updates the `selectedBookingInfo` text in real-time to reflect the time slot currently aligned with the `selectorBar`. The `selectedTimeSlotISO` variable in [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:17) is updated when scrolling stops or a slot is centered.
    *   **Visual Highlight:** The centered time slot receives a distinct visual style (e.g., background color `#53d22c`, contrasting text `#162013`, rounded corners, shadow, as per `.time-slot-item.selected` in [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:108)). Other slots are less prominent.
    *   **Haptic Feedback (Mobile):** Consider subtle haptic feedback on mobile devices as slots snap into the central selected position.
    *   **Submit Button State:** The "Submit" button (`submitBookingButton`) is enabled once a valid time slot is selected/centered. Its text updates to "Book for {Time}" (e.g., "Book for 10:00 AM"). This is handled in [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:77) logic.
*   **Animations:**
    *   Smooth scrolling of time slots.
    *   Real-time update of `selectedBookingInfo` text.
    *   Visual transition for time slots moving into/out of the selected state.
    *   The `pulseGreen` animation on the enabled submit button ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:127)) draws attention.
    *   CSS mask gradient on `time-scroll-container` ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:58)) creates a fade effect for items scrolling in/out of view.

##### State: Month Navigation (Prev/Next Month buttons clicked)
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client wants to view availability for adjacent months.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Action:** Clicking `prevMonthButton` or `nextMonthButton` ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:266)).
    *   **Feedback:** Buttons provide visual feedback on click (e.g., scale transform).
    *   **State Update:** `currentMonth` and `currentYear` in [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:147) are updated. `selectedDate`, `selectedTimeSlotISO` are reset.
    *   **UI Reset:** Time picker is hidden. "Select an available day" message is shown. Booking info text and submit button are reset to initial states.
    *   **Data Fetch & Render:** `loadMonthOverview` ([`public/calendar-data.js`](public/calendar-data.js:72)) is called. If data is not cached or stale, a loading animation is shown while fetching. Then `renderCalendar` ([`public/calendar-ui.js`](public/calendar-ui.js:54)) updates the grid.
*   **Animations:**
    *   Loading animation if fetching new month data.
    *   Calendar grid updates (potentially with a quick fade transition between month views).
*   **Performance:** Preloading of adjacent months ([`public/calendar-data.js`](public/calendar-data.js:31)) aims to make this transition feel instant if data is ready.

### PH6-15: Calendar Mini-App: Transition to Waiver Form on "Submit"
*(Goal and Acceptance Criteria as per [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:278))*

#### Screen: Calendar WebApp ([`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0))
##### State: User clicks "Submit" button (after a valid slot is selected and PH6-14 final validation passes)
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client wants to proceed to the next step (waiver) after confirming their chosen date and time.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Pre-condition:** `selectedTimeSlotISO` is populated, `selectedDate` is set, and the `submitBookingButton` is enabled. The final client-side slot validation from PH6-14 (`validateSlotAvailability` in [`public/calendar-api.js`](public/calendar-api.js:160)) has just passed.
    *   **Action:** User clicks the `submitBookingButton`.
    *   **Feedback:**
        *   The button text might briefly change to "Proceeding..." or show a subtle loading indicator within the button.
        *   The primary feedback is the navigation to the waiver form.
    *   **Data Gathering:** [`public/calendar-app.js`](public/calendar-app.js:267) (inside the submit handler, after successful `isStillAvailable` check) gathers `telegramId`, `initialSessionTypeId` (as `sessionTypeId`), and the `selectedTimeSlotISO`.
    *   **Client-Side Redirect:**
        *   `window.location.href` is set to: `waiver-form.html?telegramId={tgId}&sessionTypeId={sTypeId}&appointmentDateTimeISO={slotISO}`.
        *   The base URL for `waiver-form.html` (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/public/`) should be configurable or dynamically determined (e.g., from `process.env.FORM_URL` if this JS is ever templated, or assumed relative if always served from same origin).
*   **Animations:** Standard browser page load transition.
*   **Error Prevention:** This step only occurs if a slot is selected and has passed the final validation. If `telegramId`, `initialSessionTypeId`, or `selectedTimeSlotISO` are missing, the redirect should not occur, and an error should be shown (though this should be caught by earlier button disable logic).
*   **Performance:** The redirect should be immediate.

---
### PH6-16: Waiver Form: Adapt to Receive & Use Calendar Data
*(Goal and Acceptance Criteria as per [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:286))*

#### Screen: Waiver Form WebApp ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0))
##### State: Page Loaded (Receiving context from Calendar App)
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client expects to see context about their selected appointment and have some personal details pre-filled to streamline the waiver process.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   **Parameter Parsing:** On load, JavaScript within [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:1088) parses `telegramId`, `sessionTypeId`, and `appointmentDateTimeISO` from the URL query parameters.
    *   **Loading State:** While fetching data, placeholders or subtle loading indicators can be shown for:
        *   Appointment details section (`appointmentInfo` div).
        *   Personal information fields that will be pre-filled.
    *   **Data Fetching (Concurrent):**
        *   **User Details:** Call `GET /api/user-data?telegramId={telegramId}` to fetch the user's registration data (name, email, phone, DOB, emergency contact). (API endpoint defined in [`src/routes/api.js`](src/routes/api.js:0), likely handled by [`src/handlers/apiHandler.js`](src/handlers/apiHandler.js:0) or a specific user API handler).
        *   **Session Type Details:** Call `GET /api/session-types/{sessionTypeId}` (API from PH6-12) to get the session `label`.
    *   **UI Update with Fetched Data:**
        *   **Appointment Context:** The `appointmentInfo` div ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:17)) is populated:
            *   `appointmentDateTime`: Displays the `appointmentDateTimeISO` formatted into a user-friendly string (e.g., "Monday, June 10, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST"). This formatting should ideally happen client-side for user's local timezone.
            *   `sessionType`: Displays "Session Type: {Session Label}".
        *   **Pre-fill Form Fields:**
            *   `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone`, `dob` fields ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:910)) are pre-filled with data from `GET /api/user-data`.
            *   Emergency contact fields (`emergencyFirstName`, `emergencyLastName`, `emergencyPhone`) are also pre-filled if available.
        *   **Hidden Fields:**
            *   `telegramId` input is populated.
            *   `appointmentDateTimeValue` input is populated with the raw `appointmentDateTimeISO`.
            *   `sessionTypeValue` input is populated with `sessionTypeId`.
    *   **Visual Consistency:** The waiver form should adopt the same aesthetic as the calendar app: dark theme, video background (as per user inspiration: "I want to use the moving background in the waiver form"), similar typography (Manrope, Noto Sans from [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:11)), and button styles. The existing [`public/waiver-form.css`](public/waiver-form.css:0) provides a base but should be reviewed for consistency with [`public/calendar-app.html`](public/calendar-app.html:0) styling.
    *   **Error Handling:**
        *   If URL parameters are missing, display a clear error: "Invalid link. Please return to Telegram and try booking again."
        *   If API calls fail, display an error: "Could not load your details. Please try refreshing or contact support."
*   **Animations:**
    *   Subtle fade-in for fetched content (appointment details, pre-filled fields).
    *   Video background provides ambient motion.
*   **Microcopy:** Clear labels for all fields. Contextual information in the `appointmentInfo` div is crucial.

### Detour Functionality: Enhanced GCal Placeholder Bookings & Dynamic Flow

This set of features refines temporary slot reservations using Google Calendar events, manages their lifecycle (including a 15-minute expiry), and introduces dynamic routing after calendar selection based on `SessionType` properties.

---
#### DF-1: Backend - Enhanced GCal Placeholder Event Management

**Goal:** Robustly create, manage, and automatically expire 15-minute placeholder bookings in Google Calendar.

**API Relationships:**
*   Modifies/Replaces: `POST /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings` (from previous DF-1).
    *   Input: `telegramId`, `sessionTypeId`, `appointmentDateTimeISO`.
    *   Output: `{ success: true, placeholderId: "googleEventId", expiresAt: "isoTimestamp", waiverType: "string", allowsGroupInvites: boolean, maxGroupSize: number, sessionTypeId: "string", appointmentDateTimeISO: "string" }`. (Returns data for dynamic routing).
*   Modifies/Replaces: `DELETE /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings/{googleEventId}`.
*   New Endpoint: `GET /api/slot-check?appointmentDateTimeISO=...&sessionTypeId=...&placeholderId=OPTIONAL_googleEventId`
    *   Output: `{ status: "RESERVED" | "AVAILABLE" | "TAKEN" | "UNAVAILABLE", placeholderValid?: boolean }`
*   Internal: Server-side Cron Job for **15-minute** expiry management.
*   Utilizes: [`src/tools/googleCalendar.js`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0).

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Creation & Dynamic Info):** `POST /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings` creates a GCal event.
    *   Title: "[PLACEHOLDER 15min] - Kambo Klarity - {SessionType Label} for {User}"
    *   Duration: Actual session duration, but system treats as a 15-min hold.
    *   Returns GCal `eventId` as `placeholderId`, calculated `expiresAt` (15 min from now), and fetched `SessionType.waiverType`, `SessionType.allowsGroupInvites`, `SessionType.maxGroupSize` for client-side routing.
*   **Req B (Cancellation):** `DELETE /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings/{googleEventId}` deletes the GCal event.
*   **Req C (Auto-Expiry Cron Job - 15 min):** Cron job deletes placeholder GCal events older than 15 minutes from their creation/intended start.
*   **Req D (Slot Status Check API):** `GET /api/slot-check`
    *   If `placeholderId` provided: Checks if the GCal placeholder event exists.
    *   Checks Google Calendar if the actual slot is free from other *confirmed* bookings.
    *   Returns status: "RESERVED" (placeholder valid), "AVAILABLE" (placeholder gone/invalid, but slot free), "TAKEN" (slot booked by another), "UNAVAILABLE" (slot blocked).

---
#### DF-2: Calendar App - Integrate Enhanced GCal Placeholder & Dynamic Redirect

**Goal:** Modify calendar app to create a 15-min GCal placeholder and redirect dynamically based on `SessionType` properties.

**API Relationships:**
*   Calls `POST /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings`.

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (API Call):** On "Submit", call `POST /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings`.
*   **Req B (Dynamic Redirect Logic):** Based on `waiverType`, `allowsGroupInvites` from API response:
    1.  If `waiverType !== "NONE"`: Redirect to `waiver-form.html?waiverType={...}&placeholderId={...}&sessionTypeId={...}&appointmentDateTimeISO={...}&allowsGroupInvites={...}&maxGroupSize={...}`.
    2.  If `waiverType === "NONE"` AND `allowsGroupInvites === true`: Redirect to `invite-friends.html?placeholderId={...}&sessionTypeId={...}&appointmentDateTimeISO={...}&maxGroupSize={...}`.
    3.  If `waiverType === "NONE"` AND `allowsGroupInvites === false`: Call new `POST /api/finalize-direct-booking` (with `placeholderId`). On success, show confirmation in calendar app & close.
*   **Req C (Finalize Direct Booking API):** `POST /api/finalize-direct-booking`
    *   Input: `placeholderId` (GCal `eventId`).
    *   Process: Validates placeholder, converts GCal placeholder to a real GCal event, creates `Session` record, notifies admin/client (similar to PH6-17 but without waiver data).

#### DF-3: Waiver Form - Conditional Logic for Primary Booker vs. Invited Friend

**Goal:** Implement distinct behaviors in `waiver-form.html` based on whether the user is a primary booker (with a `placeholderId`) or an invited friend (with an `inviteToken`). This includes reservation expiry handling and Telegram Back Button functionality.

**API Relationships:**
*   (Primary Booker) Calls `GET /api/slot-check`.
*   (Primary Booker) Calls `DELETE /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings/{googleEventId}`.
*   Utilizes `window.Telegram.WebApp.BackButton`.

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Parse All Relevant Params):** `waiver-form.html` (JS) parses `placeholderId` (GCal `eventId` for primary booker), `inviteToken` (for friend), `telegramId` (current user), `sessionTypeId`, `appointmentDateTimeISO`, `waiverType`, `allowsGroupInvites`, `maxGroupSize` from URL.
*   **Req B (Conditional Logic on Load):**
    *   **If `inviteToken` IS present (Friend's Flow):**
        1.  `Telegram.WebApp.BackButton.show()`.
        2.  Set `Telegram.WebApp.BackButton.onClick(() => Telegram.WebApp.close());`.
        3.  Do NOT display 15-minute reservation limit/countdown.
        4.  Pre-submission slot check (`GET /api/slot-check`) is NOT needed (slot is already confirmed by primary booker).
    *   **If `inviteToken` IS NOT present (Primary Booker's Flow):**
        1.  Display "Slot reserved for 15 minutes. Please complete by [time]." (Optional: client-side countdown).
        2.  `Telegram.WebApp.BackButton.show()`.
        3.  Set `Telegram.WebApp.BackButton.onClick(async () => { ... })` to:
            *   Disable back button.
            *   If `placeholderId` exists, call `DELETE /api/gcal-placeholder-bookings/{placeholderId}`.
            *   Navigate user back to `calendar-app.html` (passing `telegramId`, `initialSessionTypeId`).
            *   Handle API errors gracefully.
        4.  **Pre-Submission Check:** Before submitting waiver, call `GET /api/slot-check` with `placeholderId`.
            *   If status "TAKEN" or "UNAVAILABLE": Show error "Slot no longer available...", client calls `DELETE` for its `placeholderId` if expired, then `Telegram.WebApp.close()` or guide to back button.
            *   If "RESERVED" or "AVAILABLE": Proceed with submission.
*   **Req C (Submission Data):**
    *   If primary booker: Include `placeholderId`, `allowsGroupInvites`, `maxGroupSize` in POST to `/api/submit-waiver`.
    *   If friend: Include `inviteToken`, `allowsGroupInvites`, `maxGroupSize` (and friend's `telegramId` as the main `telegramId` for this submission) in POST to `/api/submit-waiver`.
*   **Req D (Hide Back Button on Success):** On successful waiver submission (for both primary booker and friend), call `Telegram.WebApp.BackButton.hide()`.

---
#### DF-4: Backend - Adapt Waiver Submission for Enhanced GCal Placeholders & Expiry

**Goal:** Modify waiver submission to robustly handle 15-min GCal placeholders, re-verify slot availability, and use `allowsGroupInvites` for next step.

**API Relationships:**
*   Modifies `POST /api/submit-waiver`.

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Receive Params):** API receives `placeholderId`, `allowsGroupInvites`, `maxGroupSize` along with waiver data.
*   **Req B (Placeholder Path):** If `placeholderId` is present:
    1.  **Attempt to Delete Placeholder GCal Event:** Call `googleCalendarTool.deleteCalendarEvent(placeholderId)`. If already gone, log and continue.
    2.  **Final Slot Availability Check:** *Crucially*, before creating the new confirmed GCal event, query GCal to ensure the slot is still truly free.
    3.  If slot NOT free: Return error to client (e.g., "Slot was taken while completing waiver. Please rebook.").
    4.  If slot IS free: Proceed to create the *actual* GCal event, create `Session` record.
    5.  **Conditional Redirect:** If `allowsGroupInvites` (from request or re-fetched `SessionType`) is true, include `redirectTo: '/invite-friends.html?sessionId={...}&maxGroupSize={...}'` in response.
*   **Req C (No Placeholder Path):** Handle as before (e.g., for friend invites not using this flow).

---
#### DF-5: System - Cron Job for 15-min GCal Placeholders

**Goal:** Ensure GCal placeholder events are cleared automatically after 15 minutes. (Graceful shutdown less critical if cron is robust).

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Cron Job - 15 min):** Cron job deletes placeholder GCal events (identified by title/property) older than 15 minutes.
*   **Req B (Logging):** Log cron job actions.

---
### PH6-30: API & Waiver Submit: Handle Friend's Waiver (GCal Update - Description)
*(Adapting from Details_Phase_6.md: PH6-30)*

**Goal:** Modify `POST /api/submit-waiver` for invited friends to update the primary booker's Google Calendar event description with the friend's name.

**API Relationships:**
*   Modifies existing endpoint: `POST /api/submit-waiver`.
*   Utilizes [`src/tools/googleCalendar.js`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0) to fetch and update GCal event.

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Trigger):** After a friend's waiver is successfully processed and `SessionInvite.status` is 'waiver_completed_by_friend'. This logic is part of the "friend's waiver path" within the main `/api/submit-waiver` handler.
*   **Req B (Fetch GCal Event):** Retrieve the primary booker's GCal event using `parentSession.googleEventId` (obtained by including `parentSession` when fetching `SessionInvite` by token).
*   **Req C (Update Description):**
    *   Append the friend's name (from `SessionInvite.friendNameOnWaiver`) to the GCal event's description.
    *   The description should maintain a list if multiple friends join (e.g., "Guests: Alice Smith, Bob Johnson"). The update logic should intelligently add to this list.
    *   Use [`googleCalendarTool.updateCalendarEvent`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0) (or a similar patch/update method) to modify only the description if possible, or update the whole event with the modified description.
*   **Req D (Error Handling):** Log errors if GCal update fails (e.g., event not found, API error), but do not fail the friend's booking confirmation itself. This is a secondary enhancement.

---
### PH6-30.5: Backend - Update GCal Event Title for Group Session

**Goal:** After one or more friends confirm (complete waiver) for a session, update the primary booker's Google Calendar event title to reflect it's a group session.

**API Relationships:**
*   Triggered after `POST /api/submit-waiver` successfully processes a friend's waiver (PH6-30). This logic follows the description update.
*   Utilizes [`src/tools/googleCalendar.js`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0).

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Trigger Condition):** When a `SessionInvite.status` becomes 'waiver_completed_by_friend'.
*   **Req B (Check Confirmed Friends):** After processing a friend's waiver, count the total number of `SessionInvite` records for the `parentSessionId` that have `status: 'waiver_completed_by_friend'`.
*   **Req C (Title Update Logic):**
    *   If the count of confirmed friends is exactly 1 (i.e., the *first* friend has just confirmed):
        *   Fetch the primary booker's GCal event using `parentSession.googleEventId`.
        *   Check if the current GCal event title already indicates a group session (e.g., starts with "GROUP -").
        *   If it does *not* already indicate a group session:
            *   Construct the new title. Example: If original was "{Client Name} - {SessionType Label}", new title becomes "GROUP - {Client Name} & Friend(s) - {SessionType Label}".
            *   Use [`googleCalendarTool.updateCalendarEvent`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0) to update the event's summary (title).
    *   *(Note: Subsequent friend confirmations will update the GCal event description as per PH6-30, but typically won't need to change the title again once it's marked as "GROUP".)*
*   **Req D (Idempotency):** The check (whether the title already indicates "GROUP") ensures this title change happens only once when the first friend confirms.
*   **Req E (Error Handling):** Log errors if GCal title update fails. This is a secondary enhancement.

### PH6-17: API & Waiver Submit: Create Session, GCal Event, Edit Bot Msg to Final Confirmation
*(Goal and Acceptance Criteria as per [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:296))*

#### Screen: Waiver Form WebApp ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0))
##### State: User clicks "Submit Waiver Form"
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client wants to finalize their booking by submitting the completed waiver.
*   **UI & UX Details (Client-side in [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:1246)):**
    *   **Client-Side Validation:** Before submission, robust client-side validation (using JavaScript, potentially a library like PristineJS, which is present as [`public/pristine.min.js`](public/pristine.min.js:0) but not explicitly used in the provided HTML) ensures all required fields are filled (participant info, emergency contact, signature) and mandatory checkboxes (avoidance, substance, liability, electronic signature agreements) are checked.
        *   Invalid fields are highlighted (e.g., red border).
        *   Clear error messages appear near invalid fields.
        *   The first invalid field is focused.
    *   **Feedback During Submission:**
        *   The `submitButton` is disabled.
        *   Button text changes to "Submitting..." and a spinner icon appears (as styled in [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:1059)).
    *   **Data Collection:** All form data, including hidden fields (`telegramId`, `sessionTypeId` from `sessionTypeValue`, `appointmentDateTimeISO` from `appointmentDateTimeValue`) and the structured JSON of all waiver questions/answers, is collected.
    *   **API Call:** A `POST` request is made to `/api/submit-waiver` with the collected data in the JSON body.
*   **Animations:** Spinner animation on the submit button.

#### Screen: System Processing (Backend API: `POST /api/submit-waiver`)
##### State: API Receives Waiver Data
*   **Process (Handler likely in [`src/handlers/apiHandler.js`](src/handlers/apiHandler.js:0) or a dedicated waiver API handler):**
    1.  **Input Validation:** Server-side validation of all received data (Telegram ID, Session Type ID, DateTime ISO, waiver content).
    2.  **Create `Session` Record:**
        *   Using [`src/core/prisma.js`](src/core/prisma.js:0), create a new `Session` in the database.
        *   Fields: `telegram_id`, `session_type_id_fk` (maps to `SessionType.id`), `appointment_datetime` (parsed from `appointmentDateTimeISO` and stored as UTC DateTime), `status: 'CONFIRMED'`, `liability_form_data` (JSON blob of the entire waiver form content).
    3.  **Create Google Calendar Event:**
        *   Call [`googleCalendarTool.createCalendarEvent`](src/tools/googleCalendar.js:0).
        *   Parameters: `start` (from `appointmentDateTimeISO`), `end` (calculated by adding `SessionType.durationMinutes` to start time), `summary` (e.g., "{Client First Name} {Client Last Name} - {SessionType.label}"), `description` (e.g., "Booked via Kambo Klarity Bot. Waiver submitted.").
        *   Store the returned `googleEventId` on the newly created `Session` record.
    4.  **Fetch User's `edit_msg_id`:** Retrieve `edit_msg_id` for the `telegramId` from the `Users` table (this ID was stored in PH6-09).
    5.  **Fetch `SessionType.label`:** Get the label for the `sessionTypeId`.
    6.  **Edit Original Bot Message:**
        *   Use [`telegramNotifier.editMessageText`](src/tools/telegramNotifier.js:0) (or a method that supports sending a photo with a caption).
        *   Target message: The one identified by `user.edit_msg_id`.
        *   New content: A visually appealing confirmation.
            *   **Image:** A prominent frog picture (e.g., `public/frog.png` or a specific confirmation frog image). This might require `telegramNotifier` to use `sendPhoto` and then `editMessageCaption`, or use HTML formatting if the Telegram client supports images in edited messages well.
            *   **Text:** "âœ… Your {SessionTypeLabel} session is confirmed for {Formatted Date & Time in Practitioner's Timezone}! We look forward to seeing you." (Date/Time needs to be formatted for the practitioner's timezone, which should be a system config).
        *   **Buttons:** No buttons on this message for the pure MVP (Phase 6A).
    7.  **Clear `edit_msg_id`:** Set `edit_msg_id = null` for the user in the `Users` table.
    8.  **Notify Admin:**
        *   Use [`telegramNotifier.sendAdminNotification`](src/tools/telegramNotifier.js:0).
        *   Message: "CONFIRMED BOOKING: Client {Client Name} (TGID: {telegramId}) for {SessionTypeLabel} on {Date} at {Time}. Waiver submitted."
    9.  **API Response to Waiver Form:**
        *   Return JSON: `{ success: true, message: "Booking Confirmed!" }`.
        *   (For Phase 6B, this response will be augmented with `redirectTo: '/invite-friends.html?sessionId=...'`).
*   **Error Handling (Robust):**
    *   If any step fails (DB write, GCal API error, Telegram API error for message edit):
        *   Log the detailed error using [`src/core/logger.js`](src/core/logger.js:0).
        *   Attempt to roll back or compensate if possible (e.g., if GCal event created but DB session fails, try to delete GCal event). This is complex.
        *   Return `{ success: false, message: "An error occurred while confirming your booking. Please contact support." }` to the client.
        *   Send a critical error notification to the admin with details of the failure.

#### Screen: Waiver Form WebApp ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0))
##### State: API Responds with Success
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client wants clear confirmation that their booking is complete and the waiver was successfully submitted.
*   **UI & UX Details (Client-side in [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:1423)):**
    *   On receiving `{ success: true }` from the API:
        *   Display a clear, positive success message on the page: "Booking Confirmed! Thank you. You will receive a confirmation in your Telegram chat."
        *   The submit button remains disabled, text could change to "Submitted!".
        *   After a short delay (e.g., 2-3 seconds) to allow the user to read the message, automatically call `tg.close()` to close the WebApp.
*   **Animations:** Success message can animate in. The closing of the WebApp is handled by Telegram.

##### State: API Responds with Error
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client needs to understand that the booking failed and what, if anything, they can do.
*   **UI & UX Details (Client-side in [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:1445)):**
    *   On receiving `{ success: false }`:
        *   Display the error message from the API (e.g., `data.message`). If no specific message, show a generic "Submission failed. Please try again or contact support."
        *   Re-enable the `submitButton` and revert its text to "Submit Waiver Form".
        *   The user remains on the waiver form, allowing them to retry or contact support.
*   **Error Prevention:** Providing clear error messages helps the user understand the issue.

#### Screen: Telegram Chat
##### State: Bot Message Updated to Final Confirmation
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Client sees a persistent, final confirmation of their booking directly in their Telegram chat with the bot.
*   **UI & UX Details:**
    *   The bot message previously showing "You selected {Type}. [Book Now]" is edited.
    *   **Visuals:** A prominent frog image is displayed.
    *   **Text:** "âœ… Your {SessionTypeLabel} session is confirmed for {Formatted Date & Time in Practitioner TZ}! We look forward to seeing you."
    *   **Clarity:** The message is unambiguous and celebratory.
*   **Aesthetic Appeal:** The frog image reinforces brand identity. The checkmark emoji adds a positive visual cue.
*   **Consistency:** The booking journey, which started in the bot, also concludes with a final confirmation in the bot.

---
### PH6-18: DB Updates for Invites & Group Size Management
*(Goal and Acceptance Criteria as per [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:313), adapted for `SessionType` control)*

*   **Feature Goal:** Modify database schema for "Invite Friends", with primary control of group invites residing in `SessionType`, and create `SessionInvite` table.
*   **Primary Interaction:** N/A (Backend - Database Schema).
*   **Impact on Design:**
    *   **`SessionType` fields (from PH6-11.5):** `allowsGroupInvites` (boolean) and `maxGroupSize` (integer) are the primary drivers for invite functionality.
    *   **`AvailabilityRule.max_group_size_override` (Optional New Field):**
        *   Consider adding `max_group_size_override` (Integer, nullable) to `AvailabilityRule` in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma:0). If set, this value would override `SessionType.maxGroupSize` for sessions booked under this specific rule. This allows for exceptions (e.g., a specific practitioner on a specific day can handle larger/smaller groups for a standard session type).
        *   The number of invites possible is `(effective maxGroupSize) - 1`.
    *   **`SessionInvite` Model (remains crucial):**
        *   `id` (String, UUID, PK)
        *   `parentSessionId` (Int, FK to `Session.id`)
        *   `inviteToken` (String, Unique)
        *   `status` (String, default "pending")
        *   `friendTelegramId` (BigInt, Optional, Unique per `parentSessionId`)
        *   `friendNameOnWaiver` (String, Optional)
        *   `friendLiabilityFormData` (Json, Optional) - To store friend's waiver data if it differs or needs separate tracking from the primary booker's waiver on the `Session` record.
        *   `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
    *   **Migration:** `npx prisma migrate dev`. Update seed data for `SessionType` (for `allowsGroupInvites`, `maxGroupSize`) and optionally `AvailabilityRule` (for `max_group_size_override`).
    *   **Design Implications:**
        *   `SessionType.allowsGroupInvites` and the effective `maxGroupSize` (considering `AvailabilityRule.max_group_size_override`) determine if "Invite Friends" button appears (PH6-24) and `invite-friends.html` functionality.
        *   `SessionInvite` statuses drive UI updates (PH6-21, PH6-32) and friend flow logic.

---
### PH6-19 (was PH6-17 part): `/api/submit-waiver` Redirects to `invite-friends.html`
*(Goal and Acceptance Criteria as per [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md:320))*

#### Screen: System Processing (Backend API: `POST /api/submit-waiver`)
##### State: API Successfully Processes Primary User's Waiver (and `max_group_invites > 0`)
*   **Process (Modification to PH6-17 API response):**
    *   After all steps in PH6-17 are successful (Session created, GCal event booked, admin notified, bot message edited):
    *   Fetch the `AvailabilityRule` associated with the `SessionType` of the booked `Session` to get `max_group_invites`.
    *   **Conditional Redirect Logic:**
        *   If `max_group_invites > 0` (and the "Invite Friends" feature is generally enabled):
            *   The API response to [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0) is modified from just `{ success: true, message: "Booking Confirmed!" }` to:
                `{ success: true, message: "Booking Confirmed!", redirectTo: '/invite-friends.html?sessionId=' + newSession.id + '&telegramId=' + telegramId }`
                (Note: `newSession.id` is the ID of the `Session` record just created for the primary booker).
        *   Else (if `max_group_invites == 0` or feature disabled):
            *   The API responds as in pure MVP (Phase 6A): `{ success: true, message: "Booking Confirmed!" }` (no `redirectTo`).
*   **Impact on Design:** This change in API response is the trigger for navigating the primary booker to the "Invite Friends" page, initiating Phase 6B flow.

#### Screen: Waiver Form WebApp ([`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:0))
##### State: API Responds with Success and `redirectTo`
*   **User Goals and Tasks:** Seamlessly transition from waiver submission to the "Invite Friends" page if applicable.
*   **UI & UX Details (Client-side JS modification in [`public/waiver-form.html`](public/waiver-form.html:1423)):**
    *   The JavaScript handling the successful submission response is updated:
        *   If `data.success` is true:
            *   Check if `data.redirectTo` exists in the response.
            *   If `data.redirectTo` exists:
                *   Perform `window.location.href = data.redirectTo;`. The user is navigated to `invite-friends.html` with the necessary `sessionId` and `telegramId` parameters.
            *   Else (no `redirectTo`):
                *   Display the "Booking Confirmed! Thank you." message.
                *   Call `tg.close()` after a short delay.
*   **Animations:** Standard browser page load transition to `invite-friends.html`.
*   **Error Prevention:** Ensures redirect only happens if the API explicitly provides the URL.

---
### PH6-29: Waiver Form: Friend-Specific Setup (Receiving `inviteToken`)
*(Adapting from Details_Phase_6.md: PH6-29)*

**Goal:** Ensure `public/waiver-form.html` correctly initializes for an invited friend, primarily by recognizing the `inviteToken` and setting up distinct behaviors.

**API Relationships:** None directly for this setup; it consumes URL parameters.

**Detailed Requirements:**
*   **Req A (Parameter Parsing - Friend Context):** JavaScript in `waiver-form.html` must parse `inviteToken` from the URL. This token signifies the user is an invited friend. Other parameters like `telegramId` (friend's), `sessionTypeId`, `appointmentDateTimeISO` are also parsed.
*   **Req B (Conditional Initialization - Friend's Flow):** As detailed in DF-3 (Req B - Friend's Flow):
    *   If `inviteToken` is present:
        *   The Telegram Back Button is configured to simply close the Mini App (`Telegram.WebApp.close()`).
        *   No 15-minute reservation warnings or countdowns are displayed.
        *   No pre-submission slot check (`GET /api/slot-check`) is performed for the friend.
*   **Req C (Hidden Field for `inviteToken`):** The parsed `inviteToken` must be populated into a hidden input field (e.g., `<input type="hidden" id="inviteTokenValue" name="inviteToken">`) to be included in the waiver submission data.
*   **Req D (User Data Pre-fill):** Pre-filling of the friend's known data (name, email, etc.) via `GET /api/user-data?telegramId={friend_telegramId}` should still occur as per PH6-16.

---
### PH6-XX: Admin Interface for Session Type Management (Placeholder)

**Goal:** Provide an administrative interface (details TBD - could be bot commands or a separate web UI) for managing `SessionType` properties, including `waiverType`, `allowsGroupInvites`, and `maxGroupSize`.

**Note:** This is a placeholder for a future feature. The specific implementation (bot commands, web interface) and detailed requirements will be defined later. Its existence is noted here due to its direct relationship with the dynamic booking flow logic introduced in Phase 6.

---
*I will continue with PH6-20 through PH6-34 in the next message if this structure is correct and you'd like me to proceed.*
